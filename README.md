# clilol

clilol is a CLI for the various fun services offered by [omg.lol](https://omg.lol/). At present, it supports the statuslog features (aka [status.lol/](https://status.lol/)), with support for more omg.lol services on the way.

Please see the full documentation in the `docs` directory, also available at https://mcornick.com/clilol/.

clilol is under heavy development as I add support for more services. If something looks broken, I'm probably working on fixing it; if I don't get around to it, please let me know by filing an issue.

clilol is available as open source under the terms of the MIT License.
