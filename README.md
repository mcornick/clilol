# clilol

clilol is a CLI for the various fun services offered by [omg.lol](https://omg.lol/). The services currently supported can be found in [this GitHub issue](https://github.com/mcornick/clilol/issues/6) along with the services that are intended to be supported eventually.

Please see the full documentation in the `docs` directory, also available at https://mcornick.com/clilol/.

clilol is under heavy development as I add support for more services. If something looks broken, I'm probably working on fixing it; if I don't get around to it, please let me know by filing an issue.

clilol is available as open source under the terms of the MPL-2.0 License.
