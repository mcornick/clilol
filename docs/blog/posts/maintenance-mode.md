# Maintenance Mode

clilol hasn't changed much in a long time, mostly because the omg.lol
API hasn't changed much in a long time. Recent code changes have been
around upgrading tooling and keeping dependencies up to date, rather
than adding any new features.

Since it looks like omg.lol's APIs are staying where they are, clilol
will stay here too. I'll continue to respond to dependency updates, but
unless there's a significant impact to security or some other reason to
push a new release, I probably won't. Of course, if clilol breaks, I
want to hear about it and fix it, so please open Github issues if that
happens.

Thanks!
