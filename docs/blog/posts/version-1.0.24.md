# clilol version 1.0.24

This version contains no new features, but catches up the release to various dependency updates. It also introduces the new documentation site, with the blog you are now reading.

A few version numbers were skipped while I was fixing announcements to social sites. I now have a [Bluesky account](https://bsky.app/profile/mcornick.lol) for social.lol announcements, and I have moved Mastodon announcements back over to [my social.lol account](https://social.lol/@mcornick) to allow people who are only interested in clilol to follow that one and not have to follow my main account, and vice versa.
