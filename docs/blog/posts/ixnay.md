Hello there. Still nothing particularly new in clilol, but an update
for people who use [NixOS](https://nixos.org) or its relatives. My
[nixpkgs repository](https://github.com/mcornick/nixpkgs) has been
updated with proper Nix Flakes support, since I'm now using NixOS
with flakes and wanted it to work. Instructions are in the README
of the nixpkgs repository and in the Installation chapter of the
clilol manual. The old, kludgy override method should theoretically
still work, but I haven't tested it and don't recommend it. Flakes
are the future, the future is now, etc. Anyway, if you're the Nixy
type, this one's for you. Thanks for your continued attention.
