Keep in mind that I'm not paid to write Go code, so I'm doing this in my spare time, which means it might take me a while to respond.

When filing a pull request, please explain what you're changing and why. Please use standard Go formatting (`go fmt` is your friend.) Please limit your changes to the specific thing you're fixing and isolate your changes in a topic branch that I can merge without pulling in other stuff.
