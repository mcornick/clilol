## Contributing to clilol

If you think you have a problem, improvement, or other contribution
towards the betterment of clilol, please file an issue or, where
appropriate, a pull request.

Keep in mind that I'm not paid to write Go code, so I'm doing this in my
spare time, which means it might take me a while to respond.

When filing a pull request, please explain what you're changing and why.
Please use [gofumpt](https://github.com/mvdan/gofumpt) to format your Go
code. Please limit your changes to the specific thing you're fixing and
isolate your changes in a topic branch that I can merge without pulling
in other stuff.
